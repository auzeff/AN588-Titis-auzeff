------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

ppois( ) gives me the probability for less than or equal to a number on the Poisson distribution with mean 15:

```{r}
x <- 8  # I'll primarily be changing the value of x throughout the next few questions
lambda <- 15  # The mean--it'll stay the same
prob_over8 <- 1 - ppois(x, lambda)  # I subtract the chance of hearing 8 or fewer calls from 1
prob_over8
```

### What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

I use dpois( ) to get the probability of a specific value:

```{r}
x <- 0
prob_0 <- dpois(x, lambda)
prob_0
```

### What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

dpois( ) again:

```{r}
x <- 3
prob_3 <- dpois(x, lambda)
prob_3
```

### Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30

```{r}
x <- 0:30  # x is now the range
probs <- dpois(x, lambda) 
barplot(probs, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "x", ylab = "Pr(X = x)", main = "Probability Mass Function (Poisson)")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions)

In this case i use rpois( ), which generates random values from the distribution:

```{r}
n <- 104  # The number of results to simulate--takes the place of x
sim <- rpois(104, lambda)
sim
```

### Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

I spruced up my histogram with custom labels and colors to make it look a bit nicer:

```{r}
sim_hist <- hist(sim, col = "lightblue", main = "Simulated monitoring results", xlim = c(0, 30), xlab = "Number of calls heard")
```

The distribution of my histogram doesn't look all that much like the probability mass function plot, but that will obviously vary with each simulation run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Challenges I faced

I didn't really encounter any difficulty in the homework questions themselves. The documentation in the "Help" tab for ppois( ), dpois( ), etc. was very helpful and made everything much easier.

It took me a little while to figure out how to add an image to a Quarto document, but then I realized that I could just do it through the "Insert" menu.
